* Brief
A vagrant file, and a script, for setting up a debian 11 machine. The
idea is if the script works with vagrant, then it should be able to
work on a real machine.

* Usage
** Vagrant
Install Vagrant and VirtualBox. Copy the =.env.example= file and
populate the missing values. Then run =vagrant up=. Might need to run
this command a couple of times, the first time will install any
missing vagrant plugins, the second will launch the virtual machine.
** Debian machine
Should just be able to run =bootstrap.sh=. Remeber to set up shell
environment variables (see =.env.example= for hints) before the script.
